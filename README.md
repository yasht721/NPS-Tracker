Why did I build this model?

1. Track Updates: The model needs to manually fetch updates from the NPS website on a weekly basis. It captures information about pension schemes, categories, and fund house names, to keep it up to date.

2. Calculate Scheme Performance: The model evaluates the performance of each pension scheme, considering factors such as returns and other relevant metrics. It provides insights into how well each scheme is performing.

3. Assess Growth Rate: By calculating the growth rate of pension schemes, the model enables users to assess the overall growth and progress of schemes across different categories and fund houses.

4. Estimate Expense Ratios: The model estimates the expense ratios associated with each pension scheme, providing an understanding of the managing fees charged by pension houses. It breaks down the expenses by scheme and category.

5. Historical Data: Starting from May 12, 2023, the model incorporates historical data. This allows users to analyze past performance trends, gaining valuable insights for making informed investment decisions.

In summary, the model tracks and analyzes pension scheme updates, evaluates scheme performance, calculates growth rates, estimates expense ratios, and incorporates historical data. It equips users with comprehensive information to make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies within the NPS.
